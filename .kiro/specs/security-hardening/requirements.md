# Security Hardening Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the security hardening requirements for the OLend DeFi lending platform. The platform currently has several critical security vulnerabilities that need to be addressed before production deployment, including insufficient oracle price validation, potential integer overflow in calculations, missing access controls, and inadequate protection against common DeFi attack vectors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Oracle Price Validation and Security

**User Story:** As a protocol user, I want oracle price data to be thoroughly validated and protected against manipulation, so that my collateral and borrowing positions are calculated using accurate and secure price feeds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives price data from an oracle THEN the system SHALL validate the price timestamp is not stale (within acceptable time window)
2. WHEN the system receives price data THEN the system SHALL validate the confidence interval meets minimum requirements
3. WHEN price data shows deviation beyond acceptable thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger circuit breaker mechanisms
4. WHEN oracle price manipulation is detected THEN the system SHALL pause affected operations and emit security events
5. IF oracle becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL have fallback mechanisms or graceful degradation

### Requirement 2: Mathematical Operation Safety

**User Story:** As a protocol user, I want all mathematical calculations to be protected against overflow and underflow, so that my positions and the protocol's accounting remain accurate and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing collateral value calculations THEN the system SHALL use overflow-protected arithmetic operations
2. WHEN calculating interest rates and accruals THEN the system SHALL prevent integer overflow in multiplication operations
3. WHEN performing division operations THEN the system SHALL handle division by zero scenarios gracefully
4. WHEN calculating liquidation thresholds THEN the system SHALL ensure precision is maintained without overflow
5. IF any mathematical operation would overflow THEN the system SHALL revert the transaction with appropriate error

### Requirement 3: Access Control and Authorization

**User Story:** As a protocol administrator, I want critical administrative functions to be properly protected with access controls, so that only authorized entities can modify protocol parameters and emergency functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin functions are called THEN the system SHALL verify caller has appropriate permissions
2. WHEN interest rate parameters are modified THEN the system SHALL require admin privileges and emit events
3. WHEN liquidation thresholds are changed THEN the system SHALL enforce time delays and multi-signature requirements
4. WHEN emergency pause functions are triggered THEN the system SHALL verify emergency admin role
5. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL revert with access denied error

### Requirement 4: Circuit Breaker Protection (Updated)

**User Story:** As a protocol user, I want the system to automatically protect against extreme conditions and operational failures, so that the protocol remains stable during crisis situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operation failure rates exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL activate circuit breakers
2. WHEN circuit breakers are active THEN the system SHALL block affected operations
3. WHEN conditions improve THEN the system SHALL allow automatic or manual recovery
4. WHEN global emergencies occur THEN the system SHALL provide system-wide protection
5. IF circuit breakers activate THEN the system SHALL emit comprehensive monitoring events

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Monitoring and Alerting (Updated)

**User Story:** As a protocol operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting for all security events, so that issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL emit detailed monitoring events
2. WHEN circuit breakers activate THEN the system SHALL provide clear reasoning and context
3. WHEN oracle issues are detected THEN the system SHALL alert monitoring systems
4. WHEN manipulation is detected THEN the system SHALL log comprehensive forensic information
5. IF system health degrades THEN the system SHALL provide early warning indicators

### Requirement 6: System Integration and Deployment

**User Story:** As a protocol deployer, I want all security features to be properly integrated and configured, so that the protocol can be safely deployed to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the protocol THEN all security modules SHALL be properly initialized
2. WHEN integrating security features THEN backward compatibility SHALL be maintained
3. WHEN configuring security parameters THEN validation SHALL ensure safe values
4. WHEN security features are active THEN performance impact SHALL be minimized
5. IF security configurations are invalid THEN deployment SHALL be prevented

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Testing Coverage

**User Story:** As a protocol developer, I want comprehensive test coverage including edge cases and security scenarios, so that the security hardening measures are thoroughly validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security features are implemented THEN the system SHALL have corresponding unit tests
2. WHEN edge cases exist THEN the system SHALL have specific test coverage for extreme scenarios
3. WHEN integration points exist THEN the system SHALL have cross-component interaction tests
4. WHEN mathematical operations are performed THEN the system SHALL have fuzz testing for calculations
5. IF security vulnerabilities are fixed THEN the system SHALL have regression tests preventing reintroduction
