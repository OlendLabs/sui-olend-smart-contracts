## Development Standards

### Code Style
This project strictly follows the [Move Book Code Quality Checklist](https://move-book.com/guides/code-quality-checklist):

- **Struct Definitions**: All structs must be defined as `public struct` (Move 2024 requirement)
- **Naming Conventions**: 
  - Functions: snake_case
  - Structs: PascalCase
  - Error constants: EPascalCase (e.g., `const ENotAuthorized: u64 = 0;`)
  - Other constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
  - Modules: Descriptive names (avoid generic names like `types`)
- **Documentation**: All public functions must have documentation comments in English
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error codes with meaningful messages

### Testing Requirements
- Every public function must have corresponding test cases
- Test coverage requirement: 90%+
- Include both normal flow and edge case testing
- Use Sui test framework with proper scenario management
