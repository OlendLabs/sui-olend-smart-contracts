- **Vault<T>**: Shared Object for unified liquidity management
- **VaultStatus**: Comprehensive status management (Active, Paused, DepositsOnly, WithdrawalsOnly, Inactive)
- **VaultConfig**: Configurable parameters including fees and limits
- **Daily Limits**: Withdrawal limit management with automatic reset

#### Key Features:
- **ERC-4626 Compatibility**: Standard deposit/withdraw/convert functions
- **Fee System**: Configurable deposit and withdrawal fees (0-100%)
- **Shared Object Architecture**: Each asset type has one shared Vault<T>
- **Package-Level Security**: Critical functions restricted to package access
- **Emergency Controls**: Multiple levels of emergency pause functionality

### 2. Account System (`account.move`)
Comprehensive user account management with points and level system.

#### Key Components:
- **AccountRegistry**: Global account management
- **Account**: User account with points, levels, and position tracking

#### Key Features:
- **Points System**: Multiple point types (deposit, borrow, credit points)
- **Level System**: User levels with associated benefits
- **Position Tracking**: Track user positions across the platform
- **Safe Point Deduction**: Underflow protection for point operations

### 3. YToken System (`ytoken.move`)
Simple and secure share token implementation.

#### Key Components:
- **YToken<T>**: Phantom type for share representation
- **Witness Pattern**: Secure token creation restricted to package

#### Key Features:
- **Package-Only Creation**: Prevents external token minting
- **Type Safety**: Phantom type ensures type safety
- **Minimal Design**: Optimized for performance

### 4. Liquidity Registry (`liquidity.move`)
Global registry for vault management and discovery.

#### Key Components:
- **Registry**: Global asset vault registry
- **VaultInfo**: Vault metadata and status tracking
- **LiquidityAdminCap**: Administrative capability

#### Key Features:
- **Single Vault Policy**: One vault per asset type
- **Vault Discovery**: Efficient vault lookup and management
- **State Management**: Vault lifecycle management
- **Version Control**: Protocol upgrade safety

### 5. Error Handling System (`errors.move`)
Comprehensive error code system with categorized error types:
- **Liquidity Module Errors** (1000-1999): Vault operations, permissions, state management
- **Account Module Errors** (2000-2999): Account operations, allowances, permissions
- **General Errors** (9000-9999): System-wide errors

### 6. Constants and Utilities
- **Constants** (`constants.move`): Protocol version, limits, and configuration values
- **Utilities** (`utils.move`): Version compatibility, validation, and helper functions
- **Test Helpers**: Comprehensive testing utilities and mock data

## Development Standards

### Code Style
This project strictly follows the [Move Book Code Quality Checklist](https://move-book.com/guides/code-quality-checklist):

- **Struct Definitions**: All structs must be defined as `public struct` (Move 2024 requirement)
- **Naming Conventions**: 
  - Functions: snake_case
  - Structs: PascalCase
  - Error constants: EPascalCase (e.g., `const ENotAuthorized: u64 = 0;`)
  - Other constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
  - Modules: Descriptive names (avoid generic names like `types`)
- **Documentation**: All public functions must have documentation comments in English
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error codes with meaningful messages

### Testing Requirements
- Every public function must have corresponding test cases
- Test coverage requirement: 90%+
- Include both normal flow and edge case testing
- Use Sui test framework with proper scenario management
