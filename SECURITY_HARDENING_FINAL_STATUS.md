- **Coverage**: 324/324 tests passing
- **Types**: Unit tests, fuzz tests, edge case tests, regression tests
- **Focus**: Mathematical operations, oracle validation, circuit breakers

### ‚ùå Skipped (Not Applicable for Sui Move)

#### 4. Access Control and Authorization System
- **Reason**: Too complex for DeFi; Sui Move has built-in capability system
- **Alternative**: Using existing admin capabilities in each module

#### 5. Reentrancy Protection System  
- **Reason**: Sui Move is automatically immune to reentrancy attacks
- **Details**: 
  - Object ownership model prevents concurrent access
  - Transaction atomicity eliminates intermediate states
  - No arbitrary external contract calls
  - Move's resource safety ensures linear usage

#### 6. Flash Loan and MEV Protection
- **Reason**: Not needed in Sui blockchain architecture
- **Details**:
  - No traditional flash loan mechanisms
  - Different consensus model (Narwhal & Bullshark)
  - No mempool manipulation opportunities
  - Object-level parallel processing reduces MEV
